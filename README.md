** Project Details

This project is developed in Swift using VIPER pattern, API client with POP(Protocol Oriented Programming) used for making server calls are native and using the URLSession. Used today's best practices like generics, Codable, Extensions, VIPER, Computed properties and also OOPS concepts for ENDPoint class, which ever new client is required it can be easily created by overriding the required properties.

Constants are created for the application for the easy localization or any content change. Computed properties are used in the model which will give the leverage to keep the codable keys as it is and access the user required data with ease. Reachabiliy class for network change. APIHelpers are added just to show the other way with swift client to use
